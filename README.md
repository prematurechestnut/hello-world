# hello-world
I'm starting a BSc (Honours) IT & Computing with The Open University in Jan 2022 and I'm trying to figure out if I could learn to programme before 'commit'ing to a focus on Networking & Communication in future module choices.  I have at least a year to determine this, maximum two years, whilst also studying a degree part-time.  I have many hobbies but I'm pushing many aside to pursue this course of study with hopes of eventually taking that money pill.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, world!";
	return 0;
}
